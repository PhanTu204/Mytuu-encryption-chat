Mockito is currently self-attaching to enable the inline-mock-maker. This will no longer work in future releases of the JDK. Please add Mockito as an agent to your build what is described in Mockito's documentation: https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#0.3
WARNING: A Java agent has been loaded dynamically (C:\Users\APC\.m2\repository\net\bytebuddy\byte-buddy-agent\1.15.11\byte-buddy-agent-1.15.11.jar)
WARNING: If a serviceability tool is in use, please run with -XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading to hide this warning
WARNING: If a serviceability tool is not in use, please run with -Djdk.instrument.traceUsage for more information
WARNING: Dynamic loading of agents will be disallowed by default in a future release
